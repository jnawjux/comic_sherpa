### Primary data source downloads:
Data files used can be found here: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html
The relavent files used from the "Per Category files" section:
* reviews_Books.json
* meta_Books.json
* reviews_Movies_and_TV.json
* meta_Movies_and_TV.json
Be aware that they are very large! (~25GB in total). The files saved at different checkpoints in my walkthrough are much smaller and easier to work wtih, so I recommend using those when starting at sections past my original EDA.
